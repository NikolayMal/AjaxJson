Install Node.JS onto the machine that you are using, with the link below: https://nodejs.org/en/

After installing, open cmd and navigate to the folder which contains the 'app.js' file.

Once you are there, run the command 'node app.js'.

This will run the nodeJS server on your localhost. To access it go to this URL: http://localhost:8080/components/index.html
